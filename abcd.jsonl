            "question": "What difference does the legal context make with respect to Equal Pay for Equal Work?",
            "answer": "The context of the law behind Equal Pay for Equal Work is to provide equal pay and to prevent discrimination based on seniority. Therefore, a senior employee receiving a lower pay than a junior employee may create an anomaly; however, this anomaly may exist based on specific circumstances, and there may be legit reasons for the same."

            "answer": "No, according to the High Court in the present case, a senior cannot claim pay parity merely based on junior employees receiving a higher pay as their seniority has no relevance to their entitlement to a higher pay.

          {
            "question": "What are the requirements for senior employees to claim pay parity?",
            "answer": "For senior employees to claim pay parity, the service particulars of the senior and junior employees must be identical, there must be an anomaly that arises in the junior employees' pay fixation compared to their entitlement, and the anomaly must be such that the differentia is based on intelligible criteria that has a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved."
